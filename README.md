# diskox_mobile_app

- Added search on dropdown
- Moved referral
- Added notifcation message to the forget password

- Link privacy policy to web
- Link t&c to web
- Show interests page on sign up
- Fix success message on interest page
- Fix google signin/signup with multiple accounts

To fix:

- Community posts duplication

For Wisdom:

- Someone that is not part of a community can see the community members
- The message after declining community post is Post approved
- Cannot revoke invitation to community

- There's a logic error, you cannot have member request for a private community

- After unsuspending user, the user is still showing in suspension

is_member_request_pending - value to check before pending

# To note

- Start by msking sure deleted message is not highlightable or action can't be performed on it
- Redesign the message box of chat
